In the summer of 2017, as a volunteer teacher for a technology-teaching program in Sri Lanka, Colombo, I gained exposure to various aspects of education and felt a great responsibility to promote education equality. I taught computer science for three classes ranging from grade 5 to grade 11 in a slum school. Most of my students only attended class in the early morning because they were required to return home to share their parentsâ€™ housework, and the dropout rate is surprisingly high, especially for girls. To boost general learning motivation and their interest in learning the command of PowerPoint and Excel, I incorporated many cultural elements, the knowledge of most updated technology, and the stories about how less privileged people gradually gained a better future through education to design my course content and corresponding practice. My students told me that they felt strived to pursue higher education in a better-resourced world after taking my class. Though all of my 80 students pass the final exam successfully, I left the school with fixed feeling: a realization that the unequal distribution of education resources lead to bifurcated future of children and the significant role of effective education policy will play to narrow this gap.

Graduated from Nanjing University, Economics Department, I work at WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION currently.

I am interested in how institutional and financial innovations could make the difference on the country development and designing program to alleviate the scope of inequality.

Also, I am working on building a society simulator which uses machine learning to mimic the working of the society and predict the impact of the policies.

I work at WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION currently.

Having spent significant time in rural areas in China, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Zimbabwe, I have refined my interests to apply data science to tackle social issues, especially in impoverished areas.

I am interested in how institutional and financial innovations could make the difference on the country development and designing program to alleviate the scope of inequality.

I am also working on building a society simulator which uses machine learning to mimic the working of the society and predict the impact of the policies.

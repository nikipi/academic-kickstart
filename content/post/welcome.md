When I started computer vision the most common term, I found was Image derivation. In my school I learned derivation on the function, but the images are collection discreet value in terms of pixel. Its value ranges from 0 to 255   in terms of intensity. How can we apply derivative to discrete value it is not some function? Initially, I was confused and spend lots of time to figured out what exactly it means. With more digging I found Image differentiation refer to different to its pixel value.
